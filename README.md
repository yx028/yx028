## Hi there 👋

I'm James, a 23-year-old man who lives in Northern Ireland. I got interested in computers at a very young age, and since then, I have known it's what I want to do. 

Currently, I am working on many, many things: Robotics/AI, Server Builds and maintaining them. My website is based around making Magic: The Gathering more accessible to everyone. Along with my actual job of being a NOC Engineer/Cyber Security Engineer, I spend most of my days sifting through logs of servers to see issues and vulnerabilities that live within them. I build my tools and will pentest if necessary, as well as bring up servers that we manage for clients and assist with DNS, Emails pretty much whatever is needed. We are a small team. 

The tools I use everyday is pretty much everything, but if you want specifics, I use Nmap, my own custom tools, Linux, Kali Linux, React, Java and Python to name a few. 

How to reach me best is through LinkedIn. 

James
